## What is it?

_Hello, World_ is an open source game focused on teaching some basics of object-oriented code.

In a cold and desolate factory, you play as a cute little robot, distraught from all the programming bugs that are messing up your system! With no one around to help, you are on your own to save yourself as you access your console and fix the code.

Our little robot has a console that includes up to 3 sections for the player to insert their own code. The player solves puzzles involving movement, simple collision detection, and jumping physics. Each problem comes with instructions and hints to help guide the player. When the player submits their code, it gets checked to see if it is the correct solution. If it is, the code gets implemented in the game!


## How it was made

It started with a passion for making games, a [hackathon](http://wichacks.rit.edu/), and the aspiration to expose more girls to code. We hope that our game can inspire young girls to look more into the wonderful world of coding!

This cross-platform game was created in Visual Studio with [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/) using C# and OpenGL. This website is powered by [Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) and caffeine! All art assets were created in Paint Tool SAI and edited in Adobe Photoshop.
